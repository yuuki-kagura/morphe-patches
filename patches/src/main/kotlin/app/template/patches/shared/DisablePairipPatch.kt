/**
 * PairIP is a Google Play Integrity based license wrapper used by this developer's apps.
 * The manifest points `<application android:name>` at `com.pairip.application.Application`,
 * which is re-parented to the real app class, and a `LicenseContentProvider` verifies the
 * installer signature on every process start. A re-signed (patched) APK fails that check:
 * the app shows a "Something went wrong" dialog or shuts itself down.
 *
 * `LicenseClient.checkLicense(Context)` is the single entry point used by the provider,
 * so returning immediately disables the whole verification chain.
